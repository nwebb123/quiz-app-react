## Purpose:
Purpose of this application is to create a tool that I can use to study new things I'm learning. The inspiration for this project came to me one weekend after buying index cards at the store to make a new set of flashcards. While waiting in a long check-out line it occured to me that it would be useful to have a web application that I could access on my mobile device or computer that would allow me to quiz myself on topics I was currently learning. This project also serves the dual purpose of being a real-world application that could help others along their developement paths. 

This project is built using React.JS and utilizes the Context API to share state across multiple components. Web Application is styled with Tailwind CSS and is fully responsive, designed with a mobile-first approach. The initial version of this app is intended to allow a user to go through a series of multiple choice questions and to see their score displayed at the end of the quiz. Future features will include more question banks to study from and a flashcards components to study the topic before taking the quiz. 
 
## Technologies Used:
  - React.js/Context API
  - Tailwind CSS for design/styling
  - Netlify/Github for hosting and CI/CD
